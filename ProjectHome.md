## What is XIDE? ##

XFormsDB IDE (XIDE) is a tool, which helps end users in XFormsDB-based application development. In XIDE users can create, edit and manage web applications. The system provides different features to facilitate the process of application development process; it tries to hide difficulties and at the same time do not restrict users in what they can do in the system. XIDE addresses needs of end-users with different level of expertise and task complexity, starting from non-professionals to people who have programming experience.

### How to start using XIDE? ###

### What's XIDE main idea? ###

XIDE employs component-based approach for Web application development. It contains a database of self-sufficient customizable components that can be integrated into web application without any additional coding. The complexity of the component can vary: it can be a simple clock, which shows current time of the corresponding time zone; a complex photo gallery, or a map. The whole web application can be created using only those components. By customizing the component it is possible to change its appearance or behavior without changing the source code. However, users with higher skills can edit the source code or contribute their own component.
Thus, XIDE allows to develop web application by visual programming, by actual coding or mixing those two approaches, i.e. each user can choose the level of complexity that suits userâ€™s task and skills.

### Who developed XIDE? ###

XIDE is developed in Web Services Research group of Department of Media Technology, Aalto University, Finland. It has been created as a part of Ecosystem Design and Evolution (EDEN) project in Flexible Services program.
