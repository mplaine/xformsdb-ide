   <h1>Summary</h1>
<p> <h2 style="display:inline;" id="xidedefinition">XFormsDB IDE (XIDE)</h2> is a web-based visual tool for developing XFormsDB-based Web applications. It has been created as a part of Ecosystem Design and Evolution (EDEN) project in Flexible Services program. </p>

<p> XIDE is now running in a pilot mode.  It has no functional restrictions, but it is not advertised for the main user community. You can TRY IT OUT.  Please note that there are <a href="#demoapp">Demo applications</a>.</p>

<p>XIDE is designed to simply create web applications using predefined components. You can browse through components database and find a component, which fits your needs, and drag-n-drop it on your page. 
You can customize it using a set of predefined properties and parameters. You can change the source of the components or your web page if you want to add or change something. 
When the application is ready, you can publish it. It will run as a normal web application on one of our servers and will be available online.
 You can continue development of the application, and when the new version will be ready, you can easily reload the published version with the new one.  </p>

<h2 id="xmasdemo">Xmas survey demo </h2>

<p> Xmas survey is a part of combined EDEN-Lucre demo. </p>
<p>Here is a story of the demo. Department of Media Technology organizes a Christmas party for everyone at work. Last year everything was a mess. E-mail was used for planning between the organizing committee, Doodle was used to agree the date between staff in the office, one organizer coded a survey using php to find out who’s coming and are there any special requirements. URL to the survey was sent by e-mail accompanied by link to YouTube, where users could get familiar with kart racing, which was on the programme. After the event there were several links to picture galleries and YouTube, which were shared by e-mail.</p>

<p>This year people would have liked to look from the old e-mails how things were done, but it took too much effort to find the actual information from hundreds of e-mails. On top of everything the guy with PHP skills went to work to another company.</p>

<p>With uSpace and XIDE it is possible to combine existing services and create new ones with moderate xml skills. This demo shows how the party could be organized using these tools. Organizing committee has decided, that this year a curling will be an activity. After that there will be a dinner in the restaurant.</p> 

<p>A registration should be performed before the party to estimate number of people and organize the party. During the registration some additional questions will be asked to plan the menu, order drinks and reserve appropriate equipment for the activity. This survey is made in XIDE. You can find it in the list of your applications when you successfully logged in. The application is running in <a href="#demoapp">demo mode</a>.</p> 
<p>You can also check the corresponding space in <a href="/http://testbed.tml.hut.fi/uspace/">Uspace</a>. It combines several widgets related to the event: video widget to search for the curling videos; weather widget to check the weather on the party; Bus Schedule widget to plan the trip to the place where party takes place; Registration Survey widget.</p>
